## Project Overview
SDAIA Bootcamp project 1 - Exploratory Data Analysis. 

This project aims to help the police department to find the most dangerous stations in NYC so they can increase the level of surveillance over these stations and the areas nearby so that the crime rate will be lower. It was found that (86 ST, FULTON ST, 59 ST) are the most dangerous stations during the hours from 12 until 22.
