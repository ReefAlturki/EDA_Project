The goal of this project is to determine the most dangerous borough in NYC in order to identify the busiest stations in this borough, which will benefit the police department to increase the surveillance level in those stations and areas nearby.

To determine the most dangerous borough, I used pandas to perform exploratory analysis on the ‘Complaint data’ dataset. 

The figure shows that Brooklyn has the highest crime rate. I will use the MTA dataset to identify the most crowded stations in Brooklyn.
